# Environment Configuration Summary

## Current Environment Files

### ✅ `.env.production` (ACTIVE)
```bash
# Production Environment Configuration
# Uses relative URLs for nginx reverse proxy
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api/v1
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=/ws
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Note: Webhook URLs are handled by getWebhookUrl() function
# which returns https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook in production
```

### ✅ `.env.development` (ACTIVE)
```bash
# Development Environment Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8090/api/v1
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8090/ws
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### ✅ `.env.example` (TEMPLATE ONLY)
Template file for developers to copy from.

## Webhook URL Fix

The webhook URL issue has been fixed with a hardcoded production URL:

```typescript
export const getWebhookUrl = (path: string = '/payments/webhook') => {
  if (isDevelopment()) {
    return `${config.API_BASE_URL}${path}`;
  } else {
    // Hardcoded production URL for external services
    return `https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1${path}`;
  }
};
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the new `dist` folder** to your server
2. **Clear browser cache** completely
3. **Check console logs** for webhook debug information
4. **Verify** webhook URL in payment data should now be: `https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook`

## Debug Tools

- Open `environment-debug.html` in browser to test environment detection
- Check browser console for webhook debug logs when making payments
- Verify that `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production` in deployed app

## Notes

- Removed duplicate/conflicting environment files
- Webhook URL is now hardcoded for production to ensure reliability
- Environment detection logs added for debugging
