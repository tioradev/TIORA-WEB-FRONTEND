# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

## THE PROBLEM
You're still using the **OLD deployed version** on your server. The webhook URL fix IS in the built code, but your server is still serving the old files.

## THE SOLUTION
Deploy the NEW `dist` folder to your server **immediately**.

## STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

### 1. **Locate Your Current `dist` Folder**
```
E:\Personal\Saloon\TIORA-WEB-FRONTEND\dist\
```

### 2. **Upload to Your Server**
Upload the ENTIRE contents of the `dist` folder to your server's web directory:
- `dist/index.html`
- `dist/assets/index-CTMaE3GM.js` (contains the fix)
- `dist/assets/index-DwhNst81.css`
- `dist/assets/Tiora black png-nkTIZ5E4.png`

### 3. **Replace ALL Files**
**IMPORTANT:** Don't just add files - REPLACE the entire contents to ensure no old cached files remain.

### 4. **Clear Browser Cache**
After deployment:
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Or use incognito mode to test
- Or hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5`

### 5. **Verify the Fix**
After deployment and cache clear, test adding a card. You should see:
```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook"
}
```

## WHY THIS WILL WORK
The built file `index-CTMaE3GM.js` contains the hardcoded webhook URL:
```
"https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook"
```

Your server is currently serving old files that still have the relative URL.

## âš¡ DEPLOY NOW
The fix exists in your `dist` folder. Upload it to your server and the webhook URL issue will be resolved!
