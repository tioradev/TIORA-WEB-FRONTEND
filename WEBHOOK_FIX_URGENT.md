# 🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT NOTICE

## Webhook URL Issue FIXED - Action Required

### ✅ **Webhook URL Now Hardcoded**
The webhook URL is now **hardcoded** in the payment service:
```typescript
webhookUrl: webhookUrl || 'https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook'
```

### 🎯 **Expected Result After Deployment**
When you process a payment, the webhook URL should now be:
```
webhookUrl: "https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook"
```

### 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

1. **Deploy New `dist` Folder**
   - Upload the entire `dist` folder to your server
   - Replace the old files completely

2. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Clear all cached data
   - Or use hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5`

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test a payment
   - Check the payment data in browser console
   - Webhook URL should show the full https://salon.publicvm.com/api/v1/payments/webhook

### 🔍 **If Still Not Working**

If you still see `/api/v1/payments/webhook` after deployment:

1. **Check your server** - ensure new files are uploaded
2. **Browser cache** - try incognito/private mode  
3. **CDN cache** - clear any CDN cache you might have
4. **Server cache** - restart your nginx/web server

### 📁 **Files Changed**
- `src/services/paymentService.ts` - Hardcoded webhook URL
- Built files in `dist/` folder

### 💡 **Why This Works**
- No more dependency on environment variables
- No more dynamic URL construction
- Direct hardcoded value ensures reliability
- External Payable service gets the correct full URL
